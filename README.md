tyfon i --env dev
```

ðŸ‘‰ For connecting to prod server, do this instead:

```bash
tyfon i --env prod
```

```bash
npm i
```

5. run it:

```bash
npm start
```

its now accessible on [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

## Prod Setup:

This repo will automatically be deployed to GitHub Pages (`gh-pages` branch) whenever there is a commit to `main`.

ðŸ‘‰ If you want to deploy somewhere else, setup dev, but connect to prod server:

```bash
tyfon i --env prod
```

then build stuff:

```bash
npm run build
```

and put `dist/` folder on some CDN or static host.
